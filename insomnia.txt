<h3>Insomnia</h3>
														
<p>Many people suffer with insomnia - up to 30% of the population. It is one of the commonest reasons for visits to general practitioners. The author has suffered chronically with bouts of insomnia and thus has an interest in this condition. Interestingly, the author's insomnia has improved dramatically whilst writing this article!
<br><br><b>Caffeine insomnia</b>: to improve sleep the first thing to do is remove all caffeine from the diet. A lot of people have trouble metabolising caffeine and even a coffee in the morning can have an adverse effect on sleep half a day later. The author drinks one decaffeinated coffee per day and finds when well made that it tastes better than the usual brew - less bitter. Tea and cocoa (therefore chocolate) also contain caffeine although in lesser quantities.
</p>

<p><a id="ai"></a><b>Adrenal insomnia</b>: caffeine closely resembles the hormone adrenalin (also called epinephrine). Adrenalin is manufactured in the adrenal glands that sit atop the kidneys, and chronic insomnia can develop if the adrenal glands are infected with intracellular bacteria like <span>mycoplasma</span>. Large amounts of adrenalin are stored in the adrenals for "fight or flight" emergencies (adrenalin greatly increases muscle power), and these microbes rupture the stores and cell membranes leading to the release of adrenalin into the blood stream 24 hours a day. This can produce a restless edgy person with insomnia. The underlying cause of this bacterial problem is usually a toxic fungal infection in the adrenal blood vessels and tissues.
<br><br><a id="ait"></a><b>Adrenal insomnia</b>:
in the author's experience bacterial infection of the adrenal glands usually involve germs like <span>mycoplasma</span>, <span>rickettsia</span> and <span>borrellia</span>. <a href="bioresonance.com">Bioresonance</a> treatment can be very effective in the hands of a skilled practitioner. However if you do not have access to this therapy, it would be worth perhaps asking the doctor for blood testing to look for evidence of these germs or even prescribing a longish course of a suitable antibiotic. Herbs supporting the adrenal would also be useful. Many supplement companies have such a formula in their range.</p> 
<h4><b>Homeopathic notes</b>: the adrenals can be supported a low-potency drainage remedy like "Adrenoplex" (Brauer) taken 3-4x daily plus the nosode remedy Suprarenal in a 12C or 30C potency taken twice daily.

<br><br><a id="hi"></a><b>Hypothalamic insomnia</b>: there is a sleep centre in the lateral hypothalamus that is responsible for switching on sleep using a hormone called orexin. This centre can malfunction when the hypothalamus is affected by chemicals and heavy metals or infected with toxic mould. The author finds hypothalamic fungal infections in many clients.
<br><br><a id="hit"></a><b>Hypothalamic insomnia</b>: the sleep switching area of the lateral hypothalamus is close to the lateral ventricle, an extensive chamber filled with cerebrospinal fluid. The author has detected toxin-producing fungi and yeast, bacteria and protozoa living together in this chamber in countless clients. However these infections tend only to affect one side of the brain so that the switching area on the other side should theoretically be intact. Infection in both lateral ventricles suggests extensive disease in a person with poor health who may also suffer with poor concentration and failing memory.</p>
<h4><b>Homeopathic note</b>: nosodes like Hypothalamus (30C) on a twice daily basis would be helpful. Using bioresonance, kinesiology or the <a href="terms.html#vas">VAS pulse</a>, your practitioner could determine whether nosodes for toxic mould, candidiasis, or toxin-forming bacteria or protozoa were indicated. The latter two groups would include the nosodes Tetanus, C.Botulinum, Pseudomonas aerug., Staphylococcinum, Anthrachinum and Malaria tropica. The toxic fungal nosodes should include Mold Mix A, B and C (all 30C) as well as Aspergillus fum.(30C) and Candida alb.(30C, 1M and MM).

<br><br><a id="fli"></a><b>Frontal lobe insomnia</b>: the pre-optic region of the frontal lobes is involved in sleep via the neuro-transmitter GABA and the hormone galanin. Chemicals and heavy metals can affect this region. Mould is not usually the problem.
<br><br><a id="flit"></a><b>Frontal lobe insomnia</b>: destruction of the pre-optic region of both frontal lobes would be an unlikely cause of insomnia as an isolated health problem. There would be a lot of other brain dysfunction to go with the insomnia.

<p><a id="pini"></a><b>Pineal insomnia</b>: the pineal gland is the source of the sleep hormone melatonin. Many people take melatonin in the hope of a better night's sleep. The commonest reason found by the author for the failure of the pineal is the presence of toxin-producing microbes (especially mould and <span>Candida</span>) in the third ventricle of the brain where the pineal is situated.
<br><br><a id="pinit"></a><b>Pineal insomnia</b>: the pineal gland sits at the back of the third ventricle chamber in the brain and is prone to problems caused by toxic mould, <span>Candida</span> and malarial parasites. The pineal produces melatonin so this can be supplemented if production is low. 
<br><br>Aside: Many people try melatonin and find that it does not agree with them - probably because the pineal is working normally. In fact the writer finds that melatonin production is upregulated in an attempt to counter the effect of excessive adrenalin. Adding more even melatonin can upset a person. Having said this, it is still worth trying one bottle of melatonin to see if it works for you.</p>
<h4><b>Homeopathic notes</b>: the remedies Pineal Gland (15C or 30C) and Melatonin (15C or 30C) taken together twice daily are worth trying, especially if a melatonin supplement has some good effect. The pineal gland is prone to toxicity with chemicals and heavy metals and the energetic properties of these remedies may stimulate the gland to produce more sleep hormone.

<br><br><a id="pari"></a><b>Parasite insomnia</b>: the author has discovered through careful <a href="bioresonance.html">bioresonance</a> testing that worm parasites, especially their eggs and larvae, can actually make adrenalin (epinephrine) in significant quantities. The author can find no evidence to back this up in the literature on insomnia.
<br><br><b><a id="parit"></a>Parasite insomnia</b>: if you think you may have large parasites you could try one of these strategies: (a) a pharmaceutical if you know the type of worm and can convince the doctor or pharmacist to prescribe the drug; or (b) a herbal preparation containing plenty of <span>artemisia annua</span> (wormwood). There are a number of companies that make suitable products in western countries. These preparation are best taken twice daily in high dose (three capsules or tablets) well away from food (at least an hour) so that the worms get a high dose of undiluted herb. The initial dose should be taken for a good 5-7 days. 
<br><br>Note: children will have a problem with this regime. They could be tried on a lower dose as their worms are smaller. However the herbs are bitter and they may not be able to swallow large tablets or capsules. It may be better to use the pharmaceutical formulations made for children (chewables and chocolate squares). 
<br><br>Worms time their hatching to the phases of the moon, so maintenance treatment is best done for 1-2 days at the New and Full Moons each month to catch the newly hatched worms. This strategy will reduce the number of adult worms but will not kill the eggs in a gall bladder nest. Still, killing the adults will reduce the size of the nest over time and thus the amount of adrenalin produced.
<br><br>The parasites are presumably trying to wake up their host in the hope that they might feed thus providing them with more food. The author has measured high levels of adrenalin production in the egg nests of ascarids (roundworms), trematodes (fluke worms) and hookworms. These nests are often located in the gall bladder and/or bile ducts but can also be in the ascending colon with roundworms. Tapeworms and their eggs can also make adrenalin.</p> 
<h4><b>Aside</b>: Adult tapeworms can also make progesterone which they use to stop female hosts from falling pregnant. A large foetus in the abdomen and pelvic cavity could squash them.</h4>

<p><a id="piti"></a><b>Pituitary insomnia</b>: the posterior pituitary is linked via the tuber cinereum (pituitary stalk) to the hypothalamus where the hormone vasopressin (ADH) is maufactured. ADH is released especially each night to prevent the formation of urine by the kidneys. This permits a long period of sleep without having to get up to urinate. Toxic mould and yeast commonly colonise the pituitary stalk and interrupt the transfer of ADH to the posterior pituitary.
<p><a id="pitit"></a><b>Pituitary insomnia</b>: the failure of vasopressin (ADH) storage can be difficult to treat when toxic mould and yeast infect the pituitary stalk (tuber cinereum) and posterior part of the gland. Bioresonance treatment in expert hands can solve this problem by treating both the infection and the residual heavy metal toxicity after the fungi and yeast are killed. Otherwise it is possible to replace the missing ADH with the pharmaceutical desmopressin taken at bedtime. Normally this drug is used for bed-wetting in children but equally it could be used by adults to reduce the frequency of urination at night.</p> 
<h4>Homeopathic remedies can also be useful - in particular the nosodes for the Posterior Pituitary (30C) and Hypothalamus (30C) taken along with remedies for <span>Aspergillus</span> (30C) and <span>Candida albicans</span> (MM or 1M for a week then a 30C potency). A week on a high-potency nosode for Aluminium (CM or 1M), the current <a href="terms.html#p1vm">+1 valency special mineral</a> would also be valuable. This would be followed up with once daily maintenance treatment with a 200C or 30C remedy to maintain low aluminium levels.

<p><a id="wit"></a><b>Worry insomnia</b>: we have probably all had the experience of disturbed sleep over a number of days following of stressful life experience. Relaxation exercises, meditation, yoga, breathing exercises and personal counselling could all help. A short course of a short-acting pharmaceutical, herbal tablets or teas, eating sensibly, avoiding sugar, caffeine and stimulants, and seeking the emotional support of friends, family and/or work colleagues can all help get us through.
<br><br><b>Which insomnia?</b>: the difficulty the insomniac reader will face is deciding which type (or types) of insomnia they have. The insomnia caused by worm parasites with nest in the gall bladder or bile ducts  tends to wake people up at 1-2am with a rapid heart beat, discomfort in the right upper abdomen under the ribs and mild sweatiness. Waking at 3-4am could point to a pineal or adrenal problem. Frequent urination at night points to a pituitary problem. If you do not have access to a good bioresonance practitioner perhaps a kinesiologist could shed some light on the cause.

<h2>Treating insomnia</h2>
<p>Many chronic insomniacs resort to presciption sleeping tablets, melatonin and/or plant preparations containing valerian, hops and other herbs. These can help but do not address the cause. In the paragraphs below are described more specific measures to get at the root of the insomnia.
