				<p>What you put in your mouth is crucial. Unfortunately a lot of food items are contaminated with chemicals, pesticides, preservatives, toxic mould and/or heavy metals. If you have access try to eat organic produce. Not all of it is of good quality but you can reduce your exposure to harmful substances. 

				<br><br>However you may increase your exposure to mould and bacteria. Food handling is important with organic produce that has been dried, transported long distances, then stored in food bins in the retail outlet.  

				<br><br>Michael has been testing food for over 20 years on his computers. During this time he has identified common problems with certain foods.</p>

				<marquee class="mq11" behavior="slide" direction="down"><h5>Heavy metals</h5></marquee>
				
				<br><p>This information below is presented in note form. if interested, Michael has references available concerning the material presented here.

				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Arsenic</span>: found in imported garlic, root vegetables (potato, sweet potato, parsnip, turnip), onion, pepper, shellfish, chicken stock. It is also heavily used in electronics and may leak from mobile phones, tablets, laptops, monitors and LED televisions especially if they are old and on for long periods. It can also be found in the older treated pine used for decking, fencing and garden edging

				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Mercury</span>: found in	farmed and predatory fish, and the fish emulsion used on crops like tomatoes, celery, many greens, citrus, bananas, stone fruit and cashews. Fish emulsion is allowed in organic farming. Mercury is found in cheap hair dyes, perfumes, hair products, makeup and skin creams. Organic brands from well-regulated regions like Europe should be safer. Used heavily in electronic devices - mobiles, tablets, laptops. Still used in popular vaccines eg. influenza (thiomerosal)
				
				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Cadmium</span> is contained in vehicle exhaust, rust-proofing paint, artists oils, shellfish, tobacco, marijuana, may contaminate fruits like mango

				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Lead</span> may contaminate avocados from its use as a pesticide until the late 1980s. Garden soil can be contaminated by lead paint in older suburbs. Lead can be found in solder in electronics, lead-light windows, the flashing on old roofs and lipstick (especially darker colours)
				
				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Stainless Steel</span>: cookware, kettles, cafe expresso machines, instant water boilers, canned food. Can cause chronic allergy states. Safer cookware may be enamel, stoneware, Pyrex saucepans

				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Tin &amp; Antimony</span>: canned food, plastics, plastic water bottles

				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Radioactive fallout</span>: dust from nuclear testing and mining blows across the country and washes into water supplies after heavy rains where it slowly settles to the bottom. Perhaps avoid tap water for a week after heavy rains and install decent filters
				
				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Titanium</span>: toothpaste, sunscreen, makeup, stainless steel, some non-stick cookware

				<br><br><a id="aluminium"></a><span style="font-weight:bold">Aluminium</span>: deodorant (including spray cans); aluminium foil, chocolate and sweet wrappers, moulds used to set chocolate; baked goods: baking powder, bread, cakes, pancakes, biscuits, cookies, steamed buns, tarts and pies baked on aluminium trays or cake tins; potatoes, spinach, tea (green more so than black), refined salt, soy milk, coffee pods, canned drinks, aluminium cookware and drink bottles
				
				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Thallium</span>: kale, cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, brussel sprouts, banana. Vehicle exhaust fumes often contain thallium

				<marquee class="mq12" behavior="slide" direction="down"><h5>Mould and yeast</h5></marquee>

				<br>
				<p>Mould and yeast are currently using aluminium as a special mineral nutrient. Their growth relies on a mineral that adopts a +1 valency state. Other Group 3B minerals have been used for this property in the past few years including gallum, indium, thallium and boron. For now try to avoid as much <a href="articles.html#aluminium">aluminium</a> exposure as possible.

				<br><br>Mould is found in damp places, on stored food (nuts, cheese, cereals, raw muesli, pepper, teas), in garden soil and the home. 
				
				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Nuts</span>: buy local product (Californian walnuts are generally ok), wash well, pat dry, salt, roast at 120 &#176;C for 50 minutes (100 minutes for raw peanuts), then store in the fridge or freezer 
				
				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Cheese</span>: old cheese can be mouldy. Cut off the mouldy rind,  avoid buying pre-grated cheese except for baking or grilling. Best stored in the freezer
				
				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Pepper</span>: peppercorns are seeds picked up from the ground, bagged up and exported from developing countries. You would expect them to be mouldy. Always decline when restaurant staff offer to grate raw pepper onto your food
				
				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Tea</span>: gently boil teas both black and herbal for 1-2 minutes to kill mould spores

				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Cereals</span>: freezing cereals does not kill mould but does slow it down
					<br>- put raw cereals like muesli in a hot fry pan for 30-60 seconds before eating 
					<br>- clean up dust from stored foods carefully on kitchen surfaces
					<br>- organic cereals may be more contaminated 
					<br>– use extra care with imports like quinoa
				
				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Your garden</span>: use a mask and gloves when handling garden soils and composts 
				
				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Your home</span>: remove visible mould from household areas with diluted white vinegar
					<br>- examine for mould behind and under furniture especially in damp areas
					<br>- ventilate living areas well – remember the most toxic moulds do not have a musty smell
					<br>- use dehumidifiers or absorbent crystals if unable to ventilate (wardrobes, basements, attics)

				<p><span style="font-weight:bold">What is the most successful parasite?</span></p>
				
				<a id="parasites"></a>
				<marquee class="mq13" behavior="slide" direction="down"><h5>Parasites</h5></marquee>

				<br><br>
				<h3>Toxoplasmosis</h3>

				<p><span>Toxoplasma gondii</span> is the top human parasite. Statistics from around the world put infection rates at up to 90% in some countries, and it is estimated that a quarter of the human population is infected. Infection rates are higher in low-lying and coastal populations and in countries with a high dairy consumption (eg. France). 

				<br><br>Many authors consider that most of these infections are "latent" meaning they are not particularly  active. However once the parasite enters your nervous system it can colonise many areas including the brain, spinal cord and nerves. This can lead to disease problems like osteoporosis, obesity, diabetes, heart failure and indigestion. 

				<br><br>Cats are the primary host for toxoplasmosis and millions of spores may be found in cat litter and garden soil where cats are active. Toxoplasmosis is well known to contaminate fish, meat and animal milk products. Cultured dairy products like yoghurt, cheese and sour cream can be highly contaminated. The parasite can live for more than two years at low temperatures so even old cheeses could be a problem. 

				<br><br>Toxoplasmosis is a danger to pregnant women. It can travel from the gut to the sacral spinal cord then into the uterus where it can damage the foetus leading to spontaneous abortion.

				<br><br>The parasite usually enters the body in the lower stomach where it finds the vagus nerve and ascends to the brain stem. This can cause nausea, indigestion and the release of glucagon, a pancreatic hormone that signals the liver to release its sugar stores. The liver runs out of glycogen (stored sugar) by the middle of the day leading to afternoon sleepiness and sugar cravings.

				<br><br>The pancreas responds by releasing more and more insulin to counter the glucagon. The levels can go up of both hormones to 4-10X normal. This is called insulin resistance and wears out the pancreatic islet cells leading to the early onset of diabetes. The elevated blood sugar leads to increased fat deposition and obesity.

				<br><br>Around a third of our adult population is now diabetic and obese. Much of this is due to toxoplasmosis.

				<br><br>Sometimes the parasite tracks up the gastric plexus nerves into the spinal cord where it causes a burning pain between shoulder blades and acne on the back. The parasite can track down the nearby heart nerves when it can eventually cause heart failure in mostly elderly people.</p>
				
				<img class="columnimg" src="images/Beef.Steak2.600x186.gif">

				<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Qu: why are so many people infected?</span>

				<br><br>Pasteurisation of animal milk products may not be killing all the parasites. Modern pasteurisation involves the application of a small amount of heat (to 71.5 degrees C) for a short period of time (15 seconds). It is not designed to sterilise the milk. This milk (containing live parasites) is then cultured with bacteria to make yoghurt, cheese and sour cream.

				<br><br>So to avoid infection it is necessary to cook or freeze all dairy products. Raw meat and fish also carry these parasites. Four days in the deep freezer will kill toxoplasmosis. 
				
				<br><br>There are many traps – restaurants, dinner parties, drinks with canapes: raw meat, raw and smoked fish, butter, cheeses, sour cream, yoghurt. Toxo can survive for more than two years at 4<sup>0</sup>C so even parmesan cheese can be a problem. Michael once tested 20 different feta cheeses from all around the world - all were infected.

				<br><br>The parasite can be destroyed with bioresonance, but then you must be vigilant with animal products in future. When you dine out socially bring a plate of cheese and nuts that you have prepared and eat only these. Use cheese that can be fried or braised like haloumi or paneer if you are unable to do a 4-day freeze. Use long-life milk if no time to freeze milk when on holidays. Remember the milk in store-bought coffee has not been fully boiled so drink black or non-dairy coffee or tea. Eat coconut yoghurt or make your own yoghurt from dried milk powder products or dry kefir granules and thawed animal milks.

				<br><br>Toxoplasmosis is just one of a dozen protozoal parasites that can cause severe health problems in humans.</p>

				<img class="columnimg" src="images/Garlic2Cloves.cr1.gif">

				<h3>Worms</h3>

				<p>Worms colonise many people due to contamination and inadequate washing of herbs and salad foods plus contact with pets. Inadequate cooking of animal meat such as pork can also result in worm infestation with sometimes serious consequences - one client recently developed what was called diverticulitis in the ascending colon with scarring and bowel obstruction due to a chronic round worm infestation. Hospitalisation with partial bowel resection was required.

				<br><br>The growth cycle of worms is timed to the phases of moon: – roundworms and hookworms seem to hatch at the Full Moon, fluke worms at the New Moon. Once the main infestation has been treated with herbs or pharmaceuticals, maintenance treatment works best if taken at these times when new worms have just hatched. Worms breed faster in the warmer months so that two days of treatment per month may be required while in the cooler months one day should suffice to keep the population at bay.
				</p>

				<img class="columnimg" src="images/Broccolli.HR.780px.gif">

				<h3>Protozoa (protista)</h3>

				<p>These tiny parasite have names like giardia, amoeba, blastocystis, malaria, babesia, trypanosoma, leishmania, cryptosporidium, balantidium, sarcocystis, naegleria and leucocytozoon. Most live in water feeding on bacteria and smaller protista. They can be found in water tanks, ponds, creeks, rivers and town water in periods of high heat and low rainfall. They colonise our food animals and can be picked up from raw or undercooked animal products. Some are picked up by flying insects and injected into us when they bite.

				<br><br>You should filter or boil all drinking water, seal or cover container then store in refrigerator if available. Do not use tap water to rinse your mouth after tooth brushing. Avoid tap water in restaurants especially during hot dry periods – buy the expensive stuff if they do not filter their water (ask about this)

				<br><br>Some protozoa are transmitted by blood-sucking insects (mosquitos, midges, ticks), so wear suitable clothes and footwear especially if outdoors in the evening or early morning near water and/or moist vegetation in warm humid climates. Use chemical insect repellants only if simple barrier methods are not available.

				<br><br>Other protozoa are picked up by flies and cockroaches from bird and animal droppings and carried onto food – do not leave food uncovered and unattended for more than brief periods if you are living in warm climates. Cover food with suitable screens or cloths, refrigerate if possible. Raw foods should be cooked or washed well in clean filtered or recently-boiled water.
