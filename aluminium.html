	<h3>Aluminium and mould</h3>
							<p>As with the other Group 3 metals there seems to be little direct scientific evidence that aluminium stimulates mould growth. However research does suggest that fungi are able to absorb and use aluminium. In fact since early 2019 aluminium has been the preferred +1 valency mineral (<A href="terms.html#p1vm">P1VM</A>) for fungi.

							<br><br>Plants are able to resist aluminum toxicity better in soil when fungi are present, suggesting that fungi are absorbing significant amounts of aluminium(<a class="ref" name="alum1" href="images/Al_fungal_plant_growth.gif">1</a><a class="ref" name="alum1" href="ref.html#alum1">r</a>). Many fungi continue to grow in culture mediums that contain high levels of aluminium(<a class="ref" name="alum2" href="images/Aluminum_fungal_growth.gif">2</a><a class="ref" name="alum2" href="ref.html#alum2">r</a>).

							<br><br>The fungus <span>Aspergillus niger</span> is able to leach aluminium from ore significantly faster than hydrochloric acid(<a class="ref" name="alum3" href="images/Aluminium_asperg_leaching.gif">3</a><a class="ref" name="alum3" href="ref.html#alum3">r</a>). Another study found that a strain of <span>A. niger</span> was able to solubilize significant amounts of aluminium from the red mud that results from processing bauxite. The <span>Aspergillus</span> mould is so good at extracting aluminium that it is viewed as having a potential role in this industry(<a class="ref" name="alum4" href="images/Aluminium_asperg_leaching2.gif">4</a><a class="ref" name="alum4" href="ref.html#alum4">r</a>)
							.</p>

							<p>Oxalic acid production by <span>A. niger</span> is thought to be the main corrosive product used by the mould to eat into aluminium alloys. The corrosion rate measured was four times that produced by sodium chloride(<a class="ref" name="alum5" href="images/Aluminium_asperg_corros.gif">5</a><a class="ref" name="alum5" href="ref.html#alum5">r</a>). 

							<br><br>Aflatoxin production by <span>Aspergillus flavus</span> mould was noted to increase with exposure to aluminium(<a class="ref" name="alum6" href="images/Aluminium_asperg_aflatoxin.gif">6</a><a class="ref" name="alum6" href="ref.html#alum6">r</a>). Aflatoxin is one of the most dangerous and carcinogenic toxins to which humans are exposed(<a class="ref" name="alum7" href="images/Aflatoxins_Cancer.gif">7</a><a class="ref" name="alum7" href="ref.html#alum7">r</a>).

							<br><br>Another interesting snippet about mould and aluminium - a researcher reported in Nature in 2001 that a fungus had eaten its way into the aluminium in one of his CDs and destroyed the data(<a class="ref" name="alum8" href="images/Aluminum_fungus_eatsCD.gif">8</a><a class="ref" name="alum8" href="ref.html#alum8">r</a>).

							<p>While the evidence presented does not suggest that aluminium is an essential nutrient for fungi, it does suggest that fungi are willing and able to eat into and absorb it. Presumably fungi are interested in aluminium because they can use it in their metabolism.  

							<br><br>What does this mean for human exposure and how are we exposed? For most older people exposure has been reduced by the phasing out of aluminium cookware in the home. However this cookware has not been phased out in all kitchens. There still exist millions of aluminium pots and pans in the millions of smaller restaurants, diners, takeaway businesses and street food stalls that litter the planet. Stocks, broths and sauces are brewed for hours in aluminium vessels of various sizes.

							<br><br>Aluminium foil products are still in widespread use as the wrapping around chocolate blocks, and in the lining of snack foods packets. These packaging products should be lined with polymer or wax to reduce the transfer of aluminium onto the food. The amount of aluminium in chocolate varies according to the percentage of cocoa and can be over 16mg per kg(<a class="ref" name="alum9" href="images/Aluminium_chocolate1.gif">9</a><a class="ref" name="alum9" href="ref.html#alum9">r</a>).

							<br><br>Potatoes, fish, lasagna, moussaka, and pastry pies are often baked in aluminium foil sheets or trays. This way of cooking can add significant amounts of aluminium to food(<a class="ref" name="alum10" href="images/Aluminium_leakage3.gif">10</a><a class="ref" name="alum10" href="ref.html#alum10">r</a>).</p>
