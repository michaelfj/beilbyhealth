				<br>
				<p>Michael Beilby is opening the Beilby Health clinic in Manly Sydney in November 2019. The clinic is situated at Unit 2, 35-36 East Esplanade Manly, less than 80 metres from the Manly Ferry Terminal. 

				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Clinic hours</span>:
				<br>Monday 11am-2pm, 3.30pm-7pm
				<br>Wednesday 9am-12pm, 2pm-5pm
				<br>Thursday 9am-12.30pm, 2pm-5pm
				<br>Friday 9am-12.30pm, 2pm-5pm

				<br><br>Note: the clinic will open late on Mondays to suit clients who cannot easily get away from work.

				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Access</span>:			
				<br>The clinic is situated on the ground floor with half a dozen stairs at the street front but level access from the rear lane off Victoria Street. Clients with mobility problems can be dropped off and collected here with only a short 20 metre walk to Unit 2 on the western side of the building. 

				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Parking</span>: 
				<br>Two hours of free parking are available at nearby locations including the Ferry Terminal (if you spend a little at Aldi), Coles on Wentworth Street and behind the Manly library.

				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Public transport</span>:
				<br>There are bus stops across the road for Northern Beaches residents and of course the ferries arrive often from Circular Quay and other southern shore locations. 

				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Toilet</span>:
				<br>The office does not have a bathroom but clean facilities are available at ground floor level on the eastern side of the building. Collect the key from the reception area.

				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Speciality service</span>
				<br>The clinic specialises in medical bioresonance - what does this mean?</p>

				<marquee class="mq1" behavior="slide" direction="down"><h2>Bioresonance explained</h2>
				<img class="columnimg" src="images/Coriander2.HR.780px.gif"></marquee>

				<p>Resonance is about vibration. We are all familiar with vibrations - there are special sensors in our skin for vibration and our phones can be set to vibrate when we are called. We respond strongly to this vibration probably because it sounds like a large dangerous insect heading our way when you think about it.  

				<br><br>The frequency of vibration is all important. Rodents can hear much higher frequencies than humans so you can buy deterent devices that make a very high-pitched sound that you cannot hear but the rats hate. Similar with dog whistles.

				<br><br>Everything in nature is made up of atoms, and much at the atomic level is purely energetic. The atoms are composed of charged particles that oscillate in a recognizable pattern - meaning they have a recognisable vibration. 

				<br><br>So when a scientist develops a device that can record these oscillations or vibrations then these recordings can be used in carefully-designed testing equipment. These  scientists realised that there might be a market for testing these vibrational recordings against human beings and developed devices to sell that they hoped would be useful for human health problems. 

				<br><br>Michael came across such a machine over 20 years ago. It was designed by a USA-based computer scientist and inventor who found a way to digitally record the resonant energy of substances. Over 20,000 test samples were stored on a small floppy disc, the only medium available at the time to load software into a computer. The testing software runs on a very stable DOS platform that has stood the test of time.

				<br><br>Well over 10,000 people have been tested by Michael on this computer over the past 20 years. Its database contains around of 20,000 samples taken from almost everything to which we could be exposed including pathology and microbiology specimens. This enables testing of almost every body part and every type of germ.</p>
				
				<img class="columnimg" src="images/Spiral.Cauli4.HR.780px.gif">

				<p>About 12 years ago Michael acquired another bioreonance device manufactured in Germany that works at a faster rate. This is achieved by recording the complex energy vibrations emitted by a person into the software and testing the signals against this recording.   
	
				<br><br>The device comes with great database especially of the human genome. It also allows the user to record their own signals. Michael felt he needed a different type of database so he has created an additional 75,000 testing signals over the past 10 years. This task is the result of a year's full-time work effort. 

				<br><br>Michael's theory is that there are about 120 common toxins. If we can identify the specific ones that poison us, then we can modify how we eat and live to avoid exposure to them. His greatly expanded database is designed to pinpoint these toxins in over a hundred body organs and tissues.
				
				<br><br>The second stage of Michael's theory is that the resonant vibration of the toxins identified can then be used to shake or dislodge them. The effect is that they are separated from the crucial enzymes, nuclear and mitochondrial DNA to which they are bound. 

				<br><br>This then creates a detox reaction which some people find somewhat unpleasant. However it only lasts a few days before improvements are felt. 

				<br><br>The scope of the constantly renewed database means that most parts of the body can be quickly assessed to determine any toxicity issues. Toxins can then be removed using the vibrational energy of the related test signals. Removing toxic molecules from the body is comparable to causing fruit to fall from the top branches of a tree by shaking the limb at a particular frequency.

				<p>The third device used in the clinic is Russian-built. One programme on this device looks for energetic disturbances in the acupuncture points on the body and the external ear, and also measures the iridology areas on the pupil of the eye. 

				<br><br>A second programme looks in great detail in 3D-images at the different body parts and systems, measuring the energy levels of thousands of body parts over a 5-10 minute period.

				<br><br>In a third programme, reports can be generated about the most affected tissues and the possible pathological implications, potential allergies, possibly useful supplements, drugs, homeopathics and herbal medicines. A report on food compatibility is also provided. Clients have noted that this combined information is practical and very helpful. 

				<br><br>What can you expect in a consultation?</p>
				
				<marquee class="mq2" behavior="slide" direction="down"><h2>Your consultation</h2>

				<img class="columnimg" src="images/HRParsley_264x83.gif"></marquee>

				<p>The first consultation lasts for one hour. There is much to get through. Firstly your story must be heard, your medical history and situation in life. Your family history is important, as is your diet, lifestyle and physical habits. You may have reports from pathology and radiology services to view. You are welcome to bring a friend or family member to add their perspective to your situation and you may be examined physically.

				<br><br>After reviewing all this information, you are asked to place your hands on the German device for a 10 second recording process. A set of headphones from the Russian device will be placed on your head. Michael starts the testing procedure on both machines. You do not feel anything during this process which takes about 10 minutes. 

				<br><br>Once the two machines are underway, testing on the American device commences. This involves holding a small brass rod in one hand while Michael takes readings from the other hand using a brass probe that is applied with a little pressure to acupuncture points on the index finger. 

				<br><br>Michael explains what he finds during the detailed tests. The first is always related to the immune system. In recent years the big problems have been failure of the immune system at the level of the spleen, then the thymus, then the bone marrow.</p>
