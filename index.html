				<br>
				<p>The Beilby Health clinic opens in Manly Sydney in November 2019. Situated at Unit 2, 35-36 East Esplanade Manly - less than 80 metres from the Manly Ferry Terminal. 

				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Clinic hours</span>:
				<br>Monday 11am-2pm, 3.30pm-7pm
				<br>Wednesday 10am-1pm, 2.30-6pm
				<br>Thursday 9am-12.30pm, 2pm-5pm
				<br>Friday 9am-12.30pm, 2pm-5pm

				<br><br>Note: the clinic is open later on Mondays and Wednesdays to suit clients who cannot easily get away from work.

				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Access</span>			
				<br>The clinic is situated on the ground floor with half a dozen stairs at the street front but level access from the rear lane off Victoria Street. Clients with mobility problems can be dropped off and collected here with only a short 20 metre walk to Unit 2 on the western side of the building. 

				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Parking</span> 
				<br>Two hours of free parking are available at nearby locations including the Ferry Terminal (if you spend a little at Aldi), behind the Manly library and under Coles on Wentworth Street. This park is quite long - if you drive to the western end you can ascend to Darley Road. This leaves a short walk of aroud 150 metres to the clinic. 

				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Public transport</span>
				<br>There are bus stops across the road for Northern Beaches residents and of course the ferries arrive often from Circular Quay and other southern shore locations. 

				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Toilet</span>
				<br>The office does not have a bathroom but clean facilities are available at ground floor level on the eastern side of the building. Collect the key from the reception area.

				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Speciality service</span>
				<br>The clinic specialises in Medical Bioresonance. What does this mean?

   				<p>What can you expect in a consultation?</p>
				
				<a class="mq2"><h2>Your consultation</h2></a>

				<img class="columnimg" src="images/Basil_Sweet_750x180.gif">

				<p>The first consultation lasts for one hour. There is much to get through. Firstly your story must be heard, your medical history and situation in life. Your family history is important, as is your diet, lifestyle and physical habits. You may have reports from pathology and radiology services to view. You are welcome to bring a friend or family member to add their perspective to your situation and you may be examined physically.

				<p>After reviewing all this information, you are asked to place your hands on the German device for a 10 second recording process. A set of headphones from the Russian device will be placed on your head. Michael starts the testing procedure on both machines. You do not feel anything during this process which takes about 10 minutes. 

				<br><br>Once the two machines are underway, testing on the American device commences. This involves holding a small brass rod in one hand while Michael takes readings from the other hand using a brass probe that is applied with a little pressure to acupuncture points on the index finger. 

				<br><br>Michael explains what he finds during the detailed tests. The first is always related to the immune system. In recent years the big problems have been failure of the immune system at the level of the spleen, then the thymus, then the bone marrow.</p>
