				<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Pituitary &amp; hypothalamic hormones</span>

				<br><br>Many people, women especially, sense that their hormonal system is failing them as they grow older, and derive relief from various hormone replacement therapies. The gland that drives the hormonal show is the pituitary gland at the base of the brain. This gland, nestled in a small bony cave, is a favourite haunt of toxic mould, and failure of the hormonal system may be due to toxic fungal infection in the blood supply of this gland.

				<br><br>The rapid growth in the demand for in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) technology in older women in the past decades may be partly due to fungal disease in the pituitary. A fundamental strategy of IVF is to take over the role of the pituitary and artificially ripen eggs for fertilisation. In the early days of IVF this hormonal stimulation ripened many eggs and too often produced multiple pregnancies, so nowadays multiple eggs are extracted from the ovaries as they mature and implanted one at a time into the uterus after they have been fertilised and grown to a certain size.</p>
				
				<img class="columnimg" src="images/Broccolli.HR.780px.gif">
				
				<p>The pituitary gland itself is controlled by the hypothalamus above it. Some of the pituitary hormones are made here, transported to and stored in the posterior pituitary (ADH and oxytocin). The blood supply of the hypothalamus is also prone to mould infection. The hypothalamus is also bathed in the cerebrospinal fluid of the lateral ventricles. These are large chambers on either side of the hypothalamus, chambers that can become infected with toxic mould.

				<br><br>What can you do about mould in these areas? You can go to a GP who specialises in CIRS - the Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome - and ask for an MRI to investigate the lateral ventricles, hypothalamus and pituitary. If the results suggest mould then you can enquire about treatment. However most of the treatment offered in the CIRS protocols involves cholestyramine powder to soak up toxins in the bowels - a long way from your pituitary. Hormone replacement is sometime suggested with the pituitary hormone MSH - very expensive and unlikely to get you pregnant.

				<br><br>The doctor can order blood tests to see if your pituitary is working - tests for Growth Hormone, TSH, FSH, and LH (anterior pituitary hormones). If these hormones are all at low levels this suggests a pituitary or hypothalamic failure. Toxic mould may be the cause.

				<br><br>Why has there been such a rapid rise in the demand for IVF services? Is it because women are having children at a later age, or because IVF technology has come a long way? Michael feels that toxic yeast and fungal infection is on the increase in our bodies due the large amount of aluminium in our diet and environment. These microbes often attack the pituitary stalk, a slim structure that transports hormones from the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland. This might partly explain the increase in infertility in western populations.</p>

				<p><span style="font-weight:bold">What can you do to cure this?</span>

				<br><br>Pharmaceutical drugs are not really an option. There is very little available in the pharmacy that is safe, reasonably-priced and effective for internal fungal diseases. However there is a range of alternative options, options that may work better if done together. You could as follows:
				
				<br><br>Book an appointment to see Michael at Beilby Health. Michael has successfully treated this problem in many clients. If you are unable to do that then: 

				<br><br>Take a homeopathic aluminium detox while reducing your exposure to aluminium as much as possible. Consult a homeopath and request the following: Aluminium Met. in the potencies CM, M, 200C &amp; 30C. Buy small bottles (10ml) of the first three. 

				<br><br>Consult an  acupuncturist who works with the ear or scalp acupuncture systems as these are the best wasy to energise the pituitary and hypothalamus. If they use laser, ask for a good 2-3 minutes of laser treatment to points on the ear or scalp on both sides of the head per session and complete a course of 6-12 treatments. Ask the practitioner to put in indwelling needles to continue the effect until the next visit. 
				
				<br><br>Consult a homeopath and request the following mixture to be made up by the homeopathic dispensary that contains the following remedies:
					<br>Hypothalamus 30C, Pituitary (Anterior) 30C, Pituitary (Posterior) 30C,
					<br>Mould mix A13 30C, Aspergillus fum. 30C, Candida alb. M,
					<br>Mercurius sol. 200C, Plumbum met. M, Cadmium met. M
				<br><br>You would take this remedy twice daily for at least four weeks to begin with - buy a large bottle (50ml) in 70% alcohol and take 1-2 drops per dose. After the first four weeks take the drops twice daily on two days per week as maintenance.  

				<br><br>Does this protocol have much of a chance of working? Probably not but certainly better doing than nothing.</p>
