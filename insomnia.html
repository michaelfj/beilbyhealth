				<h1 class="mq4" id="manly">Better sleep</h1>
				
				<img class="columnimg" src="images/HRParsley_264x83.gif">

				<p>Many people suffer with insomnia - up to 30% of the population. It is one of the commonest reasons for visits to general practitioners. Michael has suffered bouts of insomnia and has an interest in this condition.</p>
				
				<h3>Caffeine insomnia</h3>

				<p>To improve sleep the first thing to do is remove almost all caffeine from the diet. A lot of people have trouble metabolising caffeine and even a coffee in the morning can have an adverse effect on sleep half a day later. Michael drinks one decaffeinated coffee per day in the morning and finds (when well made) that it tastes better than the caffeinated brew. Tea and cocoa (therefore chocolate) also contain caffeine although usually in lesser quantities per serve.

				<br><br>Caffeine withdrawal presents a problem for many. General irritability occurs for a week of more and cravings for the drug can be hard to resist.</p>

				<h3>Adrenal insomnia</h3>
				
				<p>Caffeine closely resembles the hormone adrenalin (also called epinephrine). Adrenalin is manufactured in the adrenal glands that sit atop the kidneys, and chronic insomnia can develop if the adrenal glands are infected with intracellular bacteria like <span style="font-style:italic">Mycoplasma</span>. Large amounts of adrenalin are stored in the adrenals for "fight or flight" emergencies (adrenalin greatly increases muscle power), and these microbes rupture the stores and cell membranes leading to the release of adrenalin into the blood stream 24 hours a day. This can produce a restless edgy person with insomnia. The underlying cause of this bacterial problem is usually a toxic fungal infection in the adrenal blood vessels and tissues.
				
				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Management</span>: bacterial infection of the adrenal glands involves germs like <span style="font-style:italic">Mycoplasma</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Rickettsia</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Borrellia</span>. Bioresonance treatment can be very effective in the hands of a skilled practitioner. However if you do not have access to this therapy, it would be worth perhaps asking the doctor for blood testing to look for evidence of these germs or even prescribing a longish course of a suitable antibiotic. Herbs supporting the adrenal would also be useful. Many supplement companies have such a formula in their range. 
				
				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Homeopathic notes</span>: the adrenals can be supported a low-potency homeopathic "drainage" remedy like Adrenoplex (Brauer) taken 3x daily plus the homeopathic Suprarenal in a 30C potency taken twice daily.</p>

				<img class="columnimg" src="images/Coriander2.HR.780px.gif">
				
				<h3>Hypothalamic insomnia</h3>
				<p>Our "sleep centre" lies in the lateral hypothalamus and is responsible for switching on sleep using a hormone called orexin. This centre can malfunction when the hypothalamus is affected by chemicals and heavy metals or infected with microbes especially toxic mould. Fungal infections are found in the hypothalamus of many clients tested on the bioresonance computers.

				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Management</span>: the sleep centres are close to the lateral ventricles, extensive chambers filled with cerebrospinal fluid. Toxin-producing fungi, yeast, bacteria and protozoa can live together in this chamber for many years. However these infections tend only to affect one side of the brain so that the switching area on the other side should theoretically be intact. Infection in both lateral ventricles suggests extensive brain disease. This may be found in people with poor general health who may also suffer with diminished mentation and failing memory.

				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Aside</span>: strangely Michael finds that the right side of the brain is solely affected in almost all males and females tested. Chance would dictate that it should be more or less equal, while the theories of TCM suggest that it should be the right side in women and the left side in men. Could this phenomenon be caused by mobile phones? Almost everybody holds their phone up to the right ear.

				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Homeopathic notes</span>: the homeopathic Hypothalamus (30C) taken twice daily would be useful initially. Over time this could be reduced to a 12C then to a 6C or 15X potency.

				<br><br>Using bioresonance, kinesiology or the VAS pulse, your practitioner could determine whether homeopathics for toxin-forming mould, <span style="font-style:italic">Candida</span>, bacteria or protozoa were useful. The latter two groups might include the following homeopathics: Tetanus, Botulinum, <span style="font-style:italic">Pseudomonas aerug.</span>, Staphylococcinum, Anthrachinum and Malaria tropica. 

				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Note</span>:There are many other microbes potentially involved in hypothalamic infections but they do not produce toxins that block immune system messaging.  

				<br><br>Anti-fungal homeopathics might include the Mold Mixes (A, B and C) in 30C potencies, Aspergillus fum.(30C) and Candida alb. With <span style="font-style:italic">Candida albicans</span>, potencies as high as MM can be required initially then gradualy reduced to a 1M, 200C then 30C potency over a period of 3-6 months. 

				<br><br>The help of a kinesiologist would be valuable to determine the correct potency. It is also reasonably easy to master simple kinesiology techniques like the O-Ring test and the Shoulder (Deltoid) Collapse test so that you can test yourself at home with the help of a loved one.</p>

				<h5>Frontal lobe insomnia</h5>
				<br>
				<p>The pre-optic region of the frontal lobes is involved in sleep via the neuro-transmitter GABA and the hormone galanin. Chemicals and heavy metals can affect this region. Mould is not usually the problem.

				<br><br>Destruction of the pre-optic region of both frontal lobes would be an unlikely cause of insomnia as an isolated health problem. There would be a lot of other brain dysfunction to go with the insomnia. A trial of GABA as a supplement may be worthwhile.

				<h5>Pineal insomnia</h5>
				<br>
				<p>The pineal gland is the source of the sleep hormone melatonin. Many people take melatonin in the hope of a better night's sleep. The commonest reason found by Michael for the failure of the pineal is the presence of toxin-producing microbes (especially mould, <span style="font-style:italic">Candida albicans</span> and malarial parasites) in the third ventricle of the brain where the pineal is situated.
				
				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Management</span>: a trial of the hormone melatonin is worthwhile however it does not agree with everyone. This can occur when the pineal is working normally or is up-regulated: the pineal may have increased its output of melatonin to counter the effect of adrenalin leakage from an infected adrenal gland. Adding more melatonin may then upset a person.

				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Homeopathic notes</span>: taking the homeopathics Pineal Gland (30C) and Melatonin (30C) is worthwhile especially if a melatonin supplement has had some good effect. Over time the potency can be reduced to 12C then 6C or 15X as assessed by kinesiology testing. The pineal gland is prone to toxicity with chemicals and heavy metals and the energetic properties of these remedies may stimulate the gland to produce more sleep hormone.

				<h5>Parasite insomnia</h5>
				<br>
				<p>Michael has discovered through careful bioresonance testing that worm parasites, especially their eggs and larvae, can make adrenalin (epinephrine) in significant quantities. There is no evidence to back this up in the scientific literature on insomnia.

				<br><br>if you think you may have large parasites you could try one of these strategies: (a) pharmaceutical: if you know the type of worm and can convince a doctor or pharmacist to prescribe the drug; or (b) herbal: a preparation containing plenty of <span font-style="italic">Artemisia annua</span> (Common wormwood). There are a number of companies that make suitable products in western countries. These preparation are best taken twice daily in high dose (three capsules or tablets) well away from food (at least an hour) so that the worms get a high dose of the undiluted herb. The initial dose should be taken for a good 5-7 days. 

				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Note</span>: children will have a problem with this regime. They could be tried on a lower dose as their worms are smaller. However the herbs are bitter and they may not be able to swallow large tablets or capsules. It may be better to use the pharmaceutical formulations made for children (chewables and chocolate squares) although these may be ineffective against the trematode (fluke worm). 

				<br><br>Worms time their hatching to the phases of the moon, so maintenance treatment is best done for 1-2 days at the New and Full Moons each month to catch the newly hatched worms. This strategy will reduce the number of adult worms but will not kill the eggs in a gall bladder nest. Still, killing the adults will reduce the size of the nest over time and thus the amount of adrenalin produced.

				<br><br>The parasites are presumably trying to wake up their host in the hope that they might feed thus providing them with more food. Michael has measured high levels of adrenalin production in the egg nests of ascarids (roundworms), trematodes (fluke worms) and hookworms. These nests are often located in the gall bladder and/or bile ducts but can also be in the ascending colon with ascarids. Tapeworms and their eggs can also make adrenalin. 

				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Aside</span>: Adult tapeworms can also make progesterone which they use to stop female hosts from falling pregnant. A large foetus in the abdomen and pelvic cavity could squash them sop they have evolved a strategy to prevent this.

				<h5>Pituitary insomnia</h5>
				<br>
				<p>The posterior pituitary is linked via the tuber cinereum (pituitary stalk) to the hypothalamus where the hormone vasopressin (ADH) is manufactured. ADH is released especially each night to prevent the formation of urine by the kidneys. This permits a long period of sleep without having to get up to urinate. Toxic mould and yeast commonly colonise the pituitary stalk and interrupt the transfer of ADH to the posterior pituitary.
				
				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Management</span>: the failure of vasopressin (ADH) storage can be difficult to treat when toxic mould and yeast infect the pituitary stalk (tuber cinereum) and posterior part of the gland. Bioresonance treatment in expert hands can solve this problem by treating both the infection and the residual heavy metal toxicity after the fungi and yeast are killed. Otherwise it is possible to replace the missing ADH with the pharmaceutical desmopressin taken at bedtime. Normally this drug is used for bed-wetting in children but equally it could be used by adults to reduce the frequency of urination at night. 
				</p>

				<h5>Worry insomnia</h5>
				<br>
				<p>We have probably all had the experience of disturbed sleep over a number of days following of stressful life experience. Relaxation exercises, meditation, yoga, breathing exercises and personal counselling could all help. A short course of a short-acting pharmaceutical, herbal tablets or teas, eating sensibly, avoiding sugar, caffeine and stimulants, and seeking the emotional support of friends, family and/or work colleagues can all help get us through.</p>
				
				<h5>Which insomnia?</h5>
				<br>
				<p>The difficulty the insomniac reader will face is deciding which type (or types) of insomnia they have. The insomnia caused by worm parasites that nest in the gall bladder or bile ducts  tends to wake people up at 1-2am with a rapid heart beat, some discomfort in the right upper abdomen under the ribs and mild sweatiness. Waking at 3-4am could point to a pineal or adrenal problem. Frequent urination at night points to a pituitary problem. If you do not have access to a good bioresonance practitioner perhaps a kinesiologist could shed some light on the cause.

				<br><br>Many chronic insomniacs resort to presciption sleeping tablets, melatonin and/or plant preparations containing valerian, hops and other herbs. These can help but do not address the cause.
