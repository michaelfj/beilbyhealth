				<h1 class="mq4" id="manly">Insomnia</h1>
				
				<img class="columnimg" src="images/HRParsley_264x83.gif">

				<p>Many people suffer with insomnia - up to 30% of the population. It is one of the commonest reasons for visits to general practitioners. The author has suffered chronically with bouts of insomnia and thus has an interest in this condition. Interestingly, the author's insomnia has improved dramatically whilst writing this article!</p>
				
				<h3>Caffeine insomnia</h3>
				<p>To improve sleep the first thing to do is remove almost all caffeine from the diet. A lot of people have trouble metabolising caffeine and even a coffee in the morning can have an adverse effect on sleep half a day later. The author drinks one decaffeinated coffee per day and finds when well made that it tastes better than the usual brew - less bitter. Tea and cocoa (therefore chocolate) also contain caffeine although in usually lesser quantities per serve.

				<br><br>Caffeine withdrawal presents a problem for many. A sense of irritability and cravings for the drug can be hard to resist. </p>

				<h3>Adrenal insomnia</h3>
				
				<p>Caffeine closely resembles the hormone adrenalin (also called epinephrine). Adrenalin is manufactured in the adrenal glands that sit atop the kidneys, and chronic insomnia can develop if the adrenal glands are infected with intracellular bacteria like <span>mycoplasma</span>. Large amounts of adrenalin are stored in the adrenals for "fight or flight" emergencies (adrenalin greatly increases muscle power), and these microbes rupture the stores and cell membranes leading to the release of adrenalin into the blood stream 24 hours a day. This can produce a restless edgy person with insomnia. The underlying cause of this bacterial problem is usually a toxic fungal infection in the adrenal blood vessels and tissues.
				
				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Management</span>: in the author's experience bacterial infection of the adrenal glands usually involve germs like <span style="font-style:italic">Mycoplasma</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Rickettsia</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Borrellia</span>. Bioresonance treatment can be very effective in the hands of a skilled practitioner. However if you do not have access to this therapy, it would be worth perhaps asking the doctor for blood testing to look for evidence of these germs or even prescribing a longish course of a suitable antibiotic. Herbs supporting the adrenal would also be useful. Many supplement companies have such a formula in their range. 
				
				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Homeopathic notes</span>: the adrenals can be supported a low-potency drainage remedy like "Adrenoplex" (Brauer) taken 3-4x daily plus the nosode remedy Suprarenal in a 12C or 30C potency taken twice daily.</p>

				<h3>Hypothalamic insomnia</h3>
				<p>There is a "sleep centre" in the lateral hypothalamus that is responsible for switching on sleep using a hormone called orexin. This centre can malfunction when the hypothalamus is affected by chemicals and heavy metals or infected with microbes especially toxic mould. Hypothalamic fungal infections are found in many clients tested on the bioresonance computers.

				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Management</span>: the sleep switching area of the lateral hypothalamus is close to the lateral ventricle, an extensive chamber filled with cerebrospinal fluid. Toxin-producing fungi and yeast, bacteria and protozoa can live together in this chamber for years. However these infections tend only to affect one side of the brain so that the switching area on the other side should theoretically be intact. Infection in both lateral ventricles suggests extensive disease in a person with poor health who may also suffer with poor concentration and failing memory.

				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Aside</span>: strangely it is the right side of the brain that is affected in almost all male and female clients tested. Could this be an effect of holding our mobiles up to the right ear?

				<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Homeopathic notes</span>: nosodes like Hypothalamus (30C) on a twice daily basis would be helpful. Using bioresonance, kinesiology or the VAS pulse, your practitioner could determine whether nosodes for toxic mould, candidiasis, or toxin-forming bacteria or protozoa were indicated. The latter two groups would include the nosodes Tetanus, C.Botulinum, Pseudomonas aerug., Staphylococcinum, Anthrachinum and Malaria tropica. The toxic fungal nosodes should include Mold Mix A, B and C (all 30C) as well as Aspergillus fum.(30C) and Candida alb.(30C, 1M and MM).
